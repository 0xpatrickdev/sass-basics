#Sass Basics

example use cases / exercises led by Hampton Catlin, the creator of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Topics covered include:

- Variables (for [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) programming / organization)
- Nesting (for easier readability / improved visual hieracrchy)
- Import/Partials (for modularization / organization)
- Mixins (for declarations and functional programming)
- Extend/Inheritance (for [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) programming / sharing css properties)
- Operators (inline math with +, -, *, /, and %)



### Getting Started 

To set up a Sass environment, run `sass --watch .` from the **root** of your project.
